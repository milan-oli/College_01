# Multiplication Table of M × N in C

## 📌 Problem Statement
Write a program to print a multiplication table of **M × N**.  
Read values of **M** and **N** from the user.

---

## 📝 Description
This C program generates a **matrix-style multiplication table** using **nested loops**.  
The number of rows is determined by **M**, and the number of columns is determined by **N**.

The program also validates input to ensure both values are **positive integers**.

---

## ⚙️ How the Program Works
1. The user enters values for `M` and `N`
2. Input is validated (only positive values are accepted)
3. An outer loop runs from `1` to `M` (rows)
4. An inner loop runs from `1` to `N` (columns)
5. Each cell prints the product `i × j`
